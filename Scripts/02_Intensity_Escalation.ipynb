    "# Analysis of Selective and Indiscriminate Violence (VS/VI) in Colombia\n",

    "## Project: VS_VI_Source_Code\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is part of the VS_VI_Source_Code project, which aims to analyze the dynamics of Selective Violence (VS) and Indiscriminate Violence (VI) in Colombia.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The primary purpose of this notebook is to process raw violence data, calculate key temporal metrics (Escalation and Intensity) for different violence types (VS, VI, and VC = VS + VI), and save the results for further analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "This notebook covers the initial data ingestion, cleaning, and metric calculation stages of the project's analytical workflow. It processes data at the Country, Department, and Region levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "This notebook implements the logic to read raw case data from Excel files, consolidate it, define and apply functions to calculate Escalation and Intensity based on monthly case counts, and store the processed data and metrics in a structured format."
